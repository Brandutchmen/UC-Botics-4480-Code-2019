# Clean Code Pledge

* I will not produce harmful code.

* The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate.  

* I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should.

* I will make frequent, small releases so that I do not impede the process of others.

* I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve our work at every opportunity. I will never allow it degrade.

* I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself and others, as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.

* I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them.

* I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision. I will not make promises without certainty. Be honest about uncertainty.

* I will never stop learning and improving my craft.
